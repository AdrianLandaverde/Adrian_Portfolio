## [Project 6: Access to Health in State of MÃ©xico](https://github.com/AdrianLandaverde/10K_Challenge)
### Python | R
   - Web Scrapping using Selenium to get data from every medical unit in the State of Mexico
   - Exploratory data analysis of the population of every county and coverage of medical units
   - Creation of variables in every point of the State of Mexico
   - Multidimensional clustering using K-means to identify the level of access to health
   - Attempt to predict the acces to health using Random Forest, KNN, SVM and logistic regression
   - Finally, the program receives an input of longitude and latitude and it shows the level of health in that zone in a map using KNN

## Project 5: Process Optimization for FEMSA-Coca Cola
### Pyhton | R
   - Data obtained from the Altamira plant of the compression and refrigeration machines
   - Exploratory data analysis of every variable in time and divided by type of beverage
   - Usage of t-test and Anova test to compare beverage production
   - Implementation of Random Forest algorithm to predict the electric power of machines based on the production
   - Reduction of dimensions using Principal Component Analysis
   - Implementation of Random Forest to predict energy per day in the whole plant in the dataset after PCA
   - *For data privacy of the company, no code neither data is shown*

## [Project 4: Mario Kart 8 combination optimization](https://github.com/AdrianLandaverde/Combinaciones_Mario_Kart_8)
### R
   - Data obtained from the stats of every driver, kart, glider and tires from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
   - Analysis of general stats and correlation between stats.
   - Multidimensional analysis using to find the optimal combination
   - Creation of a R Shiny Dashboard to find the combination nearest to certain stats using KNN
   - Web app in: https://adrian-landaverde.shinyapps.io/MarioKart8/

## [Project 3: Air pollutants predictor in the CDMX](https://github.com/AdrianLandaverde/Contaminantes_en_la_CDMX)
### R
   - Usage of a Database of every air pollutant in registered from 2010 to 2020 in the CDMX per station.
   - Time series analysis of the amount of air pollutants in every station.
   - Linear Regression to predict the amount of air polluntants in the future based on time.
   - Multiple Linear Regression to predict air pollutants based on meteorological conditions such as pression, temperature, wind speed, among others.
   - Presentation of every regression in a Shiny Dashboard in R.

## [Project 2: Analysis of genes that cause colon cancer](https://github.com/AdrianLandaverde/Genes_Cancer_de_Colon)
### R
   - Data obtained from a Microarray gene expression from Geo Datasets.
   - Analysis of gene expression in young and adult people with colon cancer in stage II and III.
   - Selection of genes based on a t-test.
   - Volcano Graph and R-I graph to find differential genes between the four groups.
   - Investigation of the main genes using genomic databases such as STRING, KEGG, Panther, and NCBI.
   - Analysis of the relation and effects of the genes that cause colon cancer evolve from stage II to stage III.

## Project 1: Calories per gram of macro and micronutrients in my vegan diet
### Python | Excel
   - Created my own database of macro and micronutrients in each food I consumed for 15 weeks.
   - Exploratory data analysis in Excel to analyze my food comsuption in those 15 weeks.
   - Usage of Linear Regression with Sickit-Learn to predict calories per gram of nutrient.
